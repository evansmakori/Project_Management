Project Management files and Materials
Sauce & Spoon is a small restaurant chain that wants to meet its annual growth and expansion goals. As one way to meet these goals, they’ve decided to launch a pilot project to test out the impact of installing new tabletop menu tablets.
The new menu tablets will allow the restaurant to serve more guests in less time and will also provide valuable data that will help Sauce & Spoon meet its business goals. The company just hired Peta as their first in-house project manager to oversee the tablet rollout. To get started on the project charter, Peta spends some time reviewing the documents provided by Sauce & Spoon and meets with some of the project’s stakeholders to get familiar with the project and the company.
Therefore, the following files are completed and uploaded to git as listed accordingly in the Master Branch
